# homebrew-mytap

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fjperini/homebrew-mytap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fjperini/homebrew-mytap)

Experimental formulas for macOS Homebrew.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install fjperini/mytap/<formula>`

Or `brew tap fjperini/mytap` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or install via URL (which will not receive updates):

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fjperini/mytap/master/Formula/<formula>.rb
```

There may be formulae in this tap that conflict with (meant to override) formulae of the same name available in other or core `Homebrew/Homebrew-*` taps. You can *prioritize* the formulae in this tap over all others with:
```
brew tap-pin qgis/qgisdev
```

## Homebrew documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/tree/master/docs#readme).
